  <p>Hello my name is Michael and I am a student at Code Nation Academy. I am participating in this program because I want to learn more about coding and programming. I am also interested in technology and engineering. 
    <br>
   This interest in engineering led me to join the Pre-Engineering CTE in high school. I am currently a junior and I'm looking forward to getting certification in senior year. With this certification I will pursue a career in Electrical Engineering. </p>
